- Handle errors gracefully
- Apply advanced search patterns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise:
1. Complete the Module 2 prerequisites setup
2. Ensure your Azure AI Search service is running
3. Verify the `handbook-samples` index exists with sample data

## üèóÔ∏è Setup Tasks

### Task 0: Environment Setup
**Goal**: Set up your development environment and verify connectivity

**Instructions**:
1. Import required libraries (`azure.search.documents`, `os`, `logging`)
2. Load environment variables for your Azure AI Search service
3. Create a SearchClient instance
4. Test the connection by performing a simple search for "*"

**Expected Output**: Connection successful message and count of documents in index

## üìù Exercise Tasks

### Task 1: Basic Text Search
**Goal**: Implement a simple keyword search function

**Scenario**: A user wants to search for articles about "python programming"

**Instructions**:
1. Create a function `basic_search(query, top=10)` that:
   - Accepts a search query string
   - Returns the specified number of results
   - Includes total count in response
2. Test with queries: "python", "machine learning", "javascript"
3. Display results showing title, author, and search score

**Expected Output**: List of relevant articles with scores

---

### Task 2: Exact Phrase Search
**Goal**: Implement phrase search for exact matches

**Scenario**: A user wants to find articles that contain the exact phrase "machine learning algorithm"

**Instructions**:
1. Create a function `phrase_search(phrase, top=10)` that:
   - Wraps the phrase in quotes for exact matching
   - Compares results with individual word search
2. Test with phrases: "web development", "data science", "artificial intelligence"
3. Show the difference between phrase search and individual word search

**Expected Output**: Comparison showing phrase vs individual word results

---

### Task 3: Boolean Search Operations
**Goal**: Implement complex search logic with boolean operators

**Scenario**: Users need to combine multiple search terms with AND, OR, NOT logic

**Instructions**:
1. Create a function `boolean_search(query, top=10)` that handles:
   - AND operations: "python AND tutorial"
   - OR operations: "javascript OR typescript"
   - NOT operations: "programming NOT beginner"
   - Combined operations: "(python OR javascript) AND tutorial"
2. Test each type of boolean operation
3. Display results with explanations of the logic used

**Expected Output**: Results demonstrating different boolean logic outcomes

---

### Task 4: Wildcard Pattern Matching
**Goal**: Implement pattern-based searching with wildcards

**Scenario**: Users want to find variations of terms or partial matches

**Instructions**:
1. Create a function `wildcard_search(pattern, top=10)` that:
   - Supports prefix matching: "program*"
   - Supports suffix matching: "*script"
   - Handles multiple wildcards: "data*science"
2. Test with patterns: "web*", "*learning", "java*"
3. Show how wildcards expand the search results

**Expected Output**: Results showing pattern matches and variations found

---

### Task 5: Field-Specific Search
**Goal**: Target specific document fields for more precise searches

**Scenario**: Users want to search only in titles, or only by specific authors

**Instructions**:
1. Create a function `field_search(query, fields, top=10)` that:
   - Searches only in specified fields (title, content, author, tags)
   - Supports multi-field searches with different priorities
   - Allows field-specific queries like "title:python"
2. Test searches in different field combinations
3. Compare results when searching all fields vs specific fields

**Expected Output**: Results showing field-targeted search effectiveness

---

### Task 6: Result Processing and Formatting
**Goal**: Process and format search results for different use cases

**Scenario**: Display results in different formats for web, mobile, and API responses

**Instructions**:
1. Create a `ResultProcessor` class with methods:
   - `format_for_web(results)`: HTML-friendly format with highlighting
   - `format_for_mobile(results)`: Compact format for mobile apps
   - `format_for_api(results)`: JSON format for API responses
   - `export_to_csv(results)`: Export results to CSV format
2. Add result filtering by score threshold
3. Implement result sorting by different criteria

**Expected Output**: Same results in multiple formats

---

### Task 7: Error Handling and Validation
**Goal**: Build robust search with comprehensive error handling

**Scenario**: Handle various error conditions gracefully

**Instructions**:
1. Create a `SafeSearchClient` class that:
   - Validates user input (empty queries, special characters)
   - Handles network errors and timeouts
   - Provides fallback search strategies
   - Returns user-friendly error messages
2. Test with invalid inputs: empty strings, special characters, very long queries
3. Simulate network errors and show recovery

**Expected Output**: Graceful error handling with helpful messages

---

### Task 8: Advanced Search Patterns
**Goal**: Implement intelligent search strategies

**Scenario**: Create a smart search system that adapts to user needs

**Instructions**:
1. Create a `SmartSearch` class with methods:
   - `progressive_search(query)`: Start specific, broaden if no results
   - `auto_suggest(partial_query)`: Suggest completions
   - `similar_articles(article_id)`: Find related content
   - `trending_searches()`: Show popular search terms
2. Implement search result caching for performance
3. Add search analytics (track popular queries, success rates)

**Expected Output**: Intelligent search behavior with adaptive results

---

## üéØ Final Challenge: Complete Search System

### Task 9: Integration Challenge
**Goal**: Combine all features into a complete search system

**Scenario**: Build a complete search interface that uses all the features you've implemented

**Instructions**:
1. Create a `TechBlogSearchSystem` class that:
   - Provides a unified interface for all search types
   - Automatically selects the best search strategy based on query
   - Includes search suggestions and auto-complete
   - Tracks and displays search statistics
2. Create a simple command-line interface for testing
3. Demonstrate all search features working together

**Expected Output**: A fully functional search system demonstrating all Module 2 concepts
