        "- **Always use fresh clients** for each operation\n",
        "- **Use `async with`** context manager for proper resource cleanup\n",
        "- **Use `await`** for all async operations\n",
        "- **Use `async for`** when iterating over search results\n",
        "- **Implement proper error handling** with specific exception types\n",
