## Best Practices for Portal Usage

### Development Workflow
1. **Prototyping**: Use Import Data wizard for initial setup
2. **Testing**: Use Search Explorer for query development
3. **Monitoring**: Use portal for operational oversight
4. **Production**: Transition to API-based management

### Query Development
1. Start with simple queries in Search Explorer
2. Gradually add complexity (filters, facets, sorting)
3. Test edge cases and error conditions
4. Export working queries for application use
5. Validate performance with realistic data volumes

### Troubleshooting Approach
1. Use portal monitoring to identify issues
2. Test queries in Search Explorer to isolate problems
3. Review indexer execution history for data issues
4. Check service health and quotas
5. Use diagnostic logs for detailed analysis

## Portal Limitations

### When to Use APIs Instead
- **Automation**: Repetitive tasks and CI/CD pipelines
- **Complex Operations**: Advanced configurations not supported in portal
- **Performance**: High-frequency operations
- **Integration**: Embedding in applications
- **Customization**: Advanced field mappings and transformations

### Portal Constraints
- Limited batch operations
- Simplified configuration options
- No version control integration
- Limited automation capabilities
- Reduced programmatic control

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Search Latency**: Query response times
- **Search QPS**: Queries per second
- **Indexing Rate**: Documents processed per second
- **Storage Usage**: Index size and growth
- **Error Rates**: Failed queries and indexing operations

### Diagnostic Tools
- **Activity Log**: Service-level operations
- **Metrics**: Performance and usage statistics
- **Diagnostic Settings**: Detailed logging configuration
- **Alerts**: Proactive monitoring and notifications

### Performance Analysis
- Query performance trends
- Indexer execution patterns
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Capacity planning insights

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Exporting Configurations
- Copy index definitions for code
- Export indexer configurations
- Generate API calls from portal actions
- Document working configurations

### Testing Strategies
- Use portal for initial query development
- Validate configurations before API implementation
- Test data source connections
- Verify field mappings and transformations

### Collaboration
- Share Search Explorer URLs for query examples
- Document portal-based troubleshooting steps
- Use portal for stakeholder demonstrations
- Provide access for non-technical team members

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you'll be ready to:
- Effectively use all Azure AI Search portal tools
- Transition from portal-based to API-based development
- Move on to intermediate modules for advanced features
