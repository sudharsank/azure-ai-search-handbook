# Best Practices - Module 3: Index Management

## Index Schema Design

### Field Configuration
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Choose clear, descriptive field names that reflect their purpose
- **Minimize Field Count**: Only include fields that will be searched, filtered, or retrieved
- **Optimize Field Attributes**: Only enable necessary attributes (searchable, filterable, sortable, facetable)
- **Choose Appropriate Data Types**: Use the most specific data type for each field

### Key Field Best Practices
- **Single Value Keys**: Always use single-value, unique identifiers as key fields
- **Stable Keys**: Choose keys that won't change over the document's lifetime
- **String Keys**: Use string type for key fields, even for numeric identifiers
- **URL-Safe Keys**: Ensure key values are URL-safe for REST API operations

### Field Attribute Optimization
- **Searchable**: Only for fields that need full-text search
- **Filterable**: For fields used in filter expressions and facets
- **Sortable**: For fields used in orderBy expressions
- **Facetable**: For fields used in faceted navigation
- **Retrievable**: Set to false for fields that don't need to be returned in results

## Performance Optimization

### Storage Efficiency
- **Minimize Index Size**: Smaller indexes perform better and cost less
- **Optimize Field Storage**: Use appropriate field types and avoid unnecessary attributes
- **Consider Field Length**: Longer text fields consume more storage and processing
- **Remove Unused Fields**: Regularly review and remove fields that aren't being used

### Query Performance
- **Design for Query Patterns**: Structure your index to support your most common queries
- **Use Appropriate Analyzers**: Choose analyzers that match your content and language
- **Optimize Facetable Fields**: Limit the number of facetable fields to improve performance
- **Consider Field Ordering**: Place frequently queried fields earlier in the schema

### Scaling Considerations
- **Plan for Growth**: Design indexes to handle expected data volume growth
- **Monitor Resource Usage**: Track storage, memory, and query performance metrics
- **Right-Size Service Tier**: Choose appropriate service tier for your workload
- **Partition Strategy**: Understand how partitions affect performance and cost

## Data Management

### Document Structure
- **Consistent Schema**: Maintain consistent document structure across all documents
- **Handle Missing Fields**: Plan for documents with missing or null field values
- **Normalize Data**: Ensure consistent data formats and values
- **Validate Input**: Implement data validation before indexing

### Document Operations
- **Batch Operations**: Use batch operations for better performance when possible
- **Unique Document Keys**: Ensure document keys are unique across the entire index
- **Handle Updates Properly**: Use merge operations for partial updates
- **Manage Document Versions**: Plan for document versioning if needed

### Data Quality
- **Clean Data**: Remove or fix malformed data before indexing
- **Consistent Formatting**: Ensure consistent date, number, and text formatting
- **Handle Special Characters**: Properly encode special characters and Unicode
- **Validate Required Fields**: Ensure required fields are present and valid

## Security and Access Control

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Use Managed Identity**: Prefer managed identity over API keys when possible
- **Secure API Keys**: Store API keys securely and rotate them regularly
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Monitor Access**: Implement logging and monitoring for access patterns

### Data Protection
- **Sensitive Data**: Avoid indexing sensitive or personally identifiable information
- **Data Encryption**: Ensure data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Logging**: Enable audit logging for compliance and security monitoring
- **Network Security**: Use private endpoints and firewall rules when appropriate

### Compliance
- **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate data retention policies
- **Right to be Forgotten**: Plan for data deletion requirements
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Consider data residency requirements
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain audit trails for compliance purposes

## Operational Excellence

### Monitoring and Alerting
- **Health Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive health monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Track key performance indicators
- **Error Monitoring**: Monitor and alert on error rates and types
- **Capacity Planning**: Monitor resource utilization trends

### Maintenance Procedures
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review index schema and usage patterns
- **Performance Tuning**: Regularly optimize based on usage patterns
- **Index Rebuilding**: Plan for periodic index rebuilds when necessary
- **Schema Evolution**: Plan for schema changes and migrations

### Backup and Recovery
- **Configuration Backup**: Maintain backups of index configurations
- **Data Export**: Implement procedures for data export and backup
- **Recovery Testing**: Regularly test recovery procedures
- **Disaster Recovery**: Plan for disaster recovery scenarios

## Development and Testing

### Development Workflow
- **Environment Separation**: Use separate indexes for development, testing, and production
- **Version Control**: Store index definitions in version control systems
- **Automated Testing**: Implement automated tests for index operations
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation

### Testing Strategies
- **Schema Validation**: Test index schema with representative data
- **Performance Testing**: Test with production-like data volumes
- **Load Testing**: Test under expected load conditions
- **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios and recovery procedures

### Deployment Practices
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Use blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates
- **Gradual Rollouts**: Implement gradual rollouts for major changes
- **Rollback Plans**: Always have rollback plans for deployments
- **Change Management**: Implement proper change management processes

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Schema Design Anti-Patterns
- ❌ **Over-Attribution**: Making all fields searchable, filterable, and sortable
- ❌ **Generic Field Names**: Using vague names like "field1", "data", "content"
- ❌ **Wrong Data Types**: Using string for numeric data or dates
- ❌ **Compound Keys**: Using multiple fields as composite keys

### Performance Anti-Patterns
- ❌ **Excessive Fields**: Including too many unnecessary fields
- ❌ **Large Text Fields**: Indexing very large text fields without consideration
- ❌ **Inappropriate Analyzers**: Using wrong analyzers for content type
- ❌ **Ignoring Metrics**: Not monitoring performance and resource usage

### Operational Anti-Patterns
- ❌ **No Backup Strategy**: Not having backup and recovery procedures
- ❌ **Hardcoded Values**: Embedding environment-specific values in configurations
- ❌ **No Monitoring**: Not implementing proper monitoring and alerting
- ❌ **Manual Processes**: Relying on manual processes for routine operations
