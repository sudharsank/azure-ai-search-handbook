## Query Fundamentals

### Understanding Search Queries

Azure AI Search supports several types of queries, each designed for different search scenarios:

1. **Simple Query Syntax** - Easy-to-use syntax for basic searches
2. **Full Lucene Query Syntax** - Advanced syntax with more operators and features
3. **Filter Expressions** - Precise filtering using OData syntax
4. **Faceted Search** - Structured navigation and filtering

### Basic Query Structure

Every search query in Azure AI Search follows this basic structure:

```
GET https://[service-name].search.windows.net/indexes/[index-name]/docs?
    api-version=2023-11-01
    &search=[query-text]
    &$filter=[filter-expression]
    &$orderby=[sort-expression]
    &$top=[page-size]
    &$skip=[offset]
```

## Simple Query Syntax

The simple query syntax is the default and most commonly used approach for basic search operations.

### Basic Text Search

```python
# Simple text search
results = search_client.search(search_text="azure search")

# Search in specific fields
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="machine learning",
    search_fields=["title", "content"]
)
```

### Query Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `+` | Required term | `+azure search` |
| `-` | Excluded term | `azure -cognitive` |
| `""` | Exact phrase | `"machine learning"` |
| `*` | Wildcard | `search*` |
| `()` | Grouping | `(azure OR microsoft) search` |

### Examples

```python
# Required and excluded terms
results = search_client.search(search_text="+azure -cognitive")

# Phrase search
results = search_client.search(search_text='"artificial intelligence"')

# Wildcard search
results = search_client.search(search_text="develop*")
```

## Filtering with OData

Filters allow you to narrow search results based on specific field values using OData syntax.

### Basic Filter Syntax

```python
# Filter by exact value
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="*",
    filter="category eq 'Technology'"
)

# Filter by range
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="*",
    filter="price ge 100 and price le 500"
)

# Filter by date
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="*",
    filter="publishedDate ge 2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
)
```

### Filter Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `eq` | Equal | `category eq 'Tech'` |
| `ne` | Not equal | `status ne 'Draft'` |
| `gt` | Greater than | `price gt 100` |
| `ge` | Greater than or equal | `rating ge 4.0` |
| `lt` | Less than | `views lt 1000` |
| `le` | Less than or equal | `age le 30` |
| `and` | Logical AND | `price gt 50 and price lt 200` |
| `or` | Logical OR | `category eq 'Tech' or category eq 'Science'` |
| `not` | Logical NOT | `not (status eq 'Draft')` |

### Collection Filters

```python
# Any element in collection matches
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="*",
    filter="tags/any(t: t eq 'python')"
)

# All elements in collection match
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="*",
    filter="tags/all(t: t ne 'deprecated')"
)
```

## Sorting and Ordering

Control the order of search results using the `order_by` parameter.

### Basic Sorting

```python
# Sort by single field
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="azure",
    order_by=["publishedDate desc"]
)

# Sort by multiple fields
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="azure",
    order_by=["category asc", "publishedDate desc"]
)
```

### Sorting Options

- **asc** - Ascending order (default)
- **desc** - Descending order
- **geo.distance()** - Sort by geographic distance

```python
# Geographic sorting
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="restaurants",
    order_by=["geo.distance(location, geography'POINT(-122.131577 47.678581)') asc"]
)
```

## Pagination

Handle large result sets efficiently using pagination parameters.

### Basic Pagination

```python
# First page (top 10 results)
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="azure",
    top=10,
    skip=0
)

# Second page (next 10 results)
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="azure",
    top=10,
    skip=10
)
```

### Pagination Best Practices

```python
def paginated_search(query, page_size=10, page_number=1):
    """
    Perform paginated search with proper error handling
    """
    skip = (page_number - 1) * page_size
    
    results = search_client.search(
        search_text=query,
        top=page_size,
        skip=skip,
        include_total_count=True
    )
    
    return {
        'results': list(results),
        'total_count': results.get_count(),
        'page': page_number,
        'page_size': page_size,
        'has_more': skip + page_size < results.get_count()
    }
```

## Result Customization

### Field Selection

Choose which fields to return in search results:

```python
# Select specific fields
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="azure",
    select=["id", "title", "summary", "publishedDate"]
)

# Exclude large fields for performance
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="azure",
    select=["id", "title", "summary"]  # Exclude 'content' field
)
```

### Search Highlighting

Highlight matching terms in search results:

```python
# Basic highlighting
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="machine learning",
    highlight_fields=["title", "content"],
    highlight_pre_tag="<mark>",
    highlight_post_tag="</mark>"
)

# Process highlighted results
for result in results:
    if '@search.highlights' in result:
        highlights = result['@search.highlights']
        if 'title' in highlights:
            print(f"Highlighted title: {highlights['title'][0]}")
```

## Advanced Query Techniques

### Boosting Fields

Give more weight to matches in specific fields:

```python
# Boost title matches
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="azure",
    search_fields=["title^3", "content"]  # Title matches weighted 3x
)
```

### Fuzzy Search

Handle typos and variations:

```python
# Enable fuzzy matching
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="machne~",  # Will match "machine"
    query_type="full"
)
```

### Regular Expressions

Use regex patterns for complex matching:

```python
# Regex search (requires full Lucene syntax)
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="/[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}/",
    query_type="full"
)
```

## Performance Optimization

### Query Performance Tips

1. **Use Filters Before Search**: Filters are faster than text search
2. **Limit Field Selection**: Only return needed fields
3. **Optimize Page Size**: Balance between performance and user experience
4. **Cache Common Queries**: Store frequently used results
5. **Use Search Fields**: Limit search to relevant fields only

```python
# Optimized query example
results = search_client.search(
    search_text="azure",
    search_fields=["title", "summary"],  # Limit search scope
    select=["id", "title", "summary"],   # Limit returned fields
    filter="category eq 'Technology'",   # Pre-filter results
    top=20                               # Reasonable page size
)
```

## Error Handling

### Common Query Errors

```python
from azure.core.exceptions import HttpResponseError

def safe_search(query_text, **kwargs):
    """
    Perform search with comprehensive error handling
    """
    try:
        results = search_client.search(search_text=query_text, **kwargs)
        return list(results)
    
    except HttpResponseError as e:
        if e.status_code == 400:
            print(f"Bad request - check query syntax: {e.message}")
        elif e.status_code == 404:
            print(f"Index not found: {e.message}")
        else:
            print(f"Search error: {e.message}")
        return []
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}")
        return []
```

### Query Validation

```python
def validate_query(query_text):
    """
    Validate query before execution
    """
    if not query_text or query_text.strip() == "":
        return False, "Query cannot be empty"
    
    if len(query_text) > 1000:
        return False, "Query too long (max 1000 characters)"
    
    # Check for balanced quotes
    if query_text.count('"') % 2 != 0:
        return False, "Unbalanced quotes in query"
    
    return True, "Query is valid"
```

## Best Practices

### Query Design

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic queries and add complexity gradually
2. **Use Appropriate Syntax**: Choose simple vs. full Lucene based on needs
3. **Combine Search and Filters**: Use both for optimal results
4. **Test Query Performance**: Monitor response times and optimize
5. **Handle Edge Cases**: Plan for empty results, errors, and timeouts

### User Experience

1. **Provide Search Suggestions**: Help users construct better queries
2. **Show Result Counts**: Let users know how many results were found
3. **Implement Faceted Navigation**: Allow users to refine results
4. **Handle No Results**: Provide helpful suggestions when searches fail
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic search, add advanced features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| No results returned | Query too restrictive | Broaden search terms or filters |
| Too many results | Query too broad | Add filters or more specific terms |
| Slow queries | Complex filters or large result sets | Optimize filters, reduce page size |
| Syntax errors | Invalid OData or Lucene syntax | Validate query syntax |
| Timeout errors | Query too complex | Simplify query or increase timeout |

### Debugging Queries

```python
def debug_search(query_text, **kwargs):
    """
    Debug search queries with detailed logging
    """
    print(f"Executing search: '{query_text}'")
    print(f"Parameters: {kwargs}")
    
    start_time = time.time()
    
    try:
        results = search_client.search(search_text=query_text, **kwargs)
        result_list = list(results)
        
        execution_time = time.time() - start_time
        print(f"Query executed in {execution_time:.2f} seconds")
        print(f"Found {len(result_list)} results")
        
        return result_list
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Query failed: {str(e)}")
        return []
```
